## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I built this project to help me organize my days better and be a little more concious about time-management. This assignment is made to solve the issue of forgetfulness and people not writing down everything they need to get done for the day. This is extrememly useful for forgetful people. Making this project, I learned how to to work with time using dayjs, and how to save entries in the local storage.

## Usage

This Planner is super simple to use. the previous hours are grayed out, current hour is red, and future time slots are green. Simply just jot down the things you have planned for the day and save the entry!
